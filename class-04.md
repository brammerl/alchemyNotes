# Why Pair Coding is Good
Pair coding allows people to work collaboratively while actively engaging and learning from other people. You get to fill in each other's gaps when it comes to knowledge and it allows you to interact with people you may not have otherwise. It's also good practice for interviews because it shows you can work collaboratively with others and work well in a team environment.
