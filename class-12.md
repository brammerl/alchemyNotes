Chart and canvas are the missing tools to create more visually pleasing websites. I believe that combining these with the things we've already learned will make creating websites much easier. 

Things we can do with Canvas: 
1. draw shapes: need to determine grid/coordinate spaces 
* the origin = top left corner (0,0)
* supports rectangles and paths 
2. Styles/Colors
* using fillStyle = color and strokStyle = color
3. drawing text
* fillText(text, x, y,[, maxWidth]) 
* strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
